## Website Development Basics

### How the Web Works
- **Client-Server Model**: A basic understanding of how a client (browser) communicates with a server to fetch and display content.
  - Clients (e.g., browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera) send requests for data.
  - Servers (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Node.js with Express) respond to these requests.
  - Curl is a command-line utility to interact with HTTP servers (e.g., `curl https://www.example.com`).

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
  - Converts domain names into IP addresses to establish a connection between clients and servers.
  - ICANN manages domain names globally.

### Technologies Used in Web Development

#### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS**: Defines the layout and appearance (presentation) of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and behavior to the webpage.

#### Backend:
- **Bots for Dynamic Pages**: Use bots or server-side scripts to dynamically generate webpages.
- **Popular Backend Technologies**:
  - **Node.js with Express**
  - **Ruby on Rails**
  - **Python & Django**
  - **Java & Spring**

#### Web Servers:
- **Apache Tomcat, IIS (Windows)**: Web servers that handle client requests.
- **Database Servers**:
  - SQL Client (e.g., SSMS) interacts with SQL databases to manage data (e.g., `SELECT * FROM students`).
